This demonstrates the setTimeout. Which means that every variable that is being requested to draw has to be shown after the set time that is set for. Example in this case the timer is set to 2000miliseconds which means after 2 seconds then the art work is shown. In this case its three different coloured circles. 
I have also learned that you can set it up for when you can execute mousepressed then it appears. This will be following the same order but replacing the setTimeout with mousepressed.

This demonstrates the set Internal. It means that the computer is able to generates what is being requested over and over after the set time. In this case its 1000miliseconds which equals to 1 second. So for every 1 seconds there is a red square being created and its randomly showing on the screen.
There is also another option that we have learned through the workshop video, this was to be able to stop controlled the amount of variable shown. Since I am having trouble with time and also understanding how to attached this file from vs code I am unable to complete this, will come back when I am able to.
I had some troubles in entering the code due to misspelled and missing some of the syntax and Chatgpt has helped me solve that problem. 
I am also having trouble entering my work straight from the vs code file. I find the p5.js editior was a bit easier for me to navigate. 
Overall, I have fun in working this out and hoping that I can apply this knowledge towards a bigger project.
